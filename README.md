# Baseball-Analytics-Trainee-Take-Home
Your project is to answer the following questions by leveraging the attached dataset that contains pitch by pitch data for all NL Central teams at the MLB, AAA, and AA levels. We have selected two random minor league pitchers for the Reds and identified them as pitcher A and pitcher B. Both pitchers are missing the variable of Induced Vertical Break for the second half of the season.



Questions:

Part 1 - Predict the missing data for both pitchers in the second half of the season.



Part 2 - Choose one of the following options:

A) After the season, the front office has decided that the best course of action for the development of the players would be to add a pitch to each arsenal for the following season. What pitch should each pitcher add to his arsenal, and project the swing and miss rate of that pitch for the 2023 season.

B) Create a dashboard to compare all relevant information for both pitchers to present to a pitching coordinator (Shiny or R Markdown if you use R / Streamlit, Plotly Dash, or Panel if you use Python). Creativity is encouraged in terms of what information you would like to include and how you would like to present the information.



Part 3 - Which pitcher would you build your future rotation around and why?
